# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18 Challenge
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to use unsupervised learning to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and group them into a classification system for this new investment. We used Python and the Pandas library to clean and organize the data, used PCA to create three principal components, created an elbow curve to find the best value of K, ran a K-means algorithm to predict the clusters, and finally created a scatter plot to help visualize the data.
